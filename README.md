This is a node CLI to convert a JSON file from a TTF file. Most of the code was **copied** from [https://github.com/gero3/facetype.js](https://github.com/gero3/facetype.js). The original project was made to be run in a browser, this tool just provides another interface.

# How to use

`$ node ./index.js -i path/to/font.ttf path/to/output.json`

# Credits

Again, all the credits go to [g3ro](https://github.com/gero3/facetype.js) who wrote the initial tool !
